# **Singapore Gran Prix 2024 Qualifying - Max Verstappen & Lando Norris Lap Comparison**

## **Overview**
This project visualizes and compares the performance of two drivers (VER & NOR) during the 2024 Singapore Grand Prix qualifying session, using telemetry data such as speed, throttle, brake, RPM, gear selection and time. The project extracts data from the FastF1 API and provides a side-by-side comparison of drivers' lap data to analyze racing performance differences. This comparison can be useful for engineers, analysts, and fans to better understand how drivers differ in their driving styles and how these impact lap times.

## **Features**
- **Driver Telemetry Comparison**: Plots key telemetry data (speed, throttle, brake, RPM, and gear) for two drivers on the same graph.
- **Delta Time Calculation**: Visualizes the time gap between two drivers over the course of a qualifying lap.
- **Corner Annotations**: Marks the circuit's corners on the speed graph to better understand driver performance through different track sections.
- **Customizable Visuals**: Supports color customization to distinguish between driver data clearly.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizing driver telemetry data.
- **FastF1**: API for extracting telemetry and session data from Formula 1 races.

## **Future Improvements**
- Improve corner annotations to prevent confusion.
- Utilize sectors to compare lap time
